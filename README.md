# TCP-Server
How to use this TCP Server:
1) Download this script by doing git clone [gitlink]
2) then run python3 TCP-Server.py
3) It should say listening on 10.0.2.15(Change it to your local host IP)
4) Run the TCP Client, which is in my projects.
5) Then it should work! You are connected to the server. If your going to change the IP on the TCP server make sure to change it on the TCP client aswell
